# Observing night with Python
A python package that can help observers generate a list of RA and Dec for their targets and find the best night for oberving. The program also saves an airmass plot for the observing night for convenience of the astronomer. Then assuming a maximum airmass, the program calculates the minimum exposure time 
needed for that night to achieve a S/N of 50.
